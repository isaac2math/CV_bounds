# CV_bounds

the Python package **CVbound** for the paper *Rademacher upper bounds for cross-validation errors with an application to the lasso* by Ning Xu (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15598)

This package includes an upper bound computation algorihtm for CV error. Compared with CV error minimization, the new upper bound minimization is much more accurate, stable and robust on regularization and overfitting control
